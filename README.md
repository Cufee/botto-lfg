# Botto-LFG
### This is a lightweight but intelligent Discord Bot that keeps a certain number of free channels in a given category on your server with built-in optimizations for large servers.
It will be a great addition to your server if you would like to declutter by removing unused channels dynamically, while being flexible in case more users want to join.

How to start:
* download the latest Release
* get a Discord bot token and paste it into config/your_token_here.dat
* rename config/your_token_here.dat to config/token.dat
* invite the bot to your server by generating and using OAuth2 Bot scope link
* adjust config/config.go
* run the executable
* use b-watchcat categoryID to enable for a category, b-lookaway categoryID to disable
